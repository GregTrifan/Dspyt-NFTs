# PinSave

## Project Description

PinSave makes decentralised version of Pinterest. We are Pavel Fedotov(@pfedprog), Grigore Gabriel Trifan (@grigore_trifan), - members of DspytDAO (@dspytdao).
We bring further utility to the NFTs, which are stored on ipfs and Filecoin. 
Now users can instantly create, share and save their decentralized posts. At the moment we have deployed web application on NEAR testnet: https://pinsave.vercel.app/.
With the help of community we will add further gamification: likes, comments and public/private feed as well as decentralized recommendation engine.
